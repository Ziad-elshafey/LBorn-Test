# LuftbornTask

A REST API for managing users, songs, and playlists, built with Express 5 and SQLite (`better-sqlite3`).

---

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps on **macOS** or **Windows** to install dependencies and run the project without common setup errors.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or higher** (recommended). Express 5 requires Node 18+, but this project’s SQLite native addon (`better-sqlite3`) works most reliably on Node 20+.
- **npm** (included with Node.js)

Check your versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### macOS

1. Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS) or via Homebrew:
  ```bash
   brew install node
  ```
2. If `npm install` fails while building `better-sqlite3`, install Xcode Command Line Tools:
  ```bash
   xcode-select --install
  ```
3. Then continue with the shared steps below.



### Windows

1. Install Node.js LTS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Prefer the installer that includes npm.
2. If `npm install` fails while compiling `better-sqlite3`, install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and select the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
3. Open a new terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) after installing build tools, then continue with the shared steps below.



### Install and run (macOS and Windows)

From the project root:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create the database, apply the schema, and seed sample data
npm run setup

# 3. Start the server
npm start
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

**Optional:** create a `.env` file in the project root to change the port:

```env
PORT=3000
```

If `.env` is missing, the app still starts on port `3000`.

**Development mode** (auto-restart on file changes):

```bash
npm run dev
```



### Important notes

- `npm run setup` runs `init-db` then `seed`.
- `npm run init-db` **deletes** any existing `database/luftborn.db` and recreates it. Re-running it wipes local data; run `npm run seed` again afterward if you need sample data.
- You do **not** need to install or configure a separate database server. SQLite stores everything in a local file.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`  
**Auth:** none  
**Content-Type:** `application/json` for request bodies  
**Error shape:** `{ "message": "<string>" }`

After `npm run setup`, seed data includes user `id: 1`, playlist `id: 1`, and songs `id: 1`–`5`.

**Relationships and constraints:**

- A **user** owns many **playlists** (`playlists.user_id` → `users.id`).
- **Playlists** and **songs** are many-to-many through `playlist_songs`.
- Deleting a user cascades to their playlists; deleting a playlist or song cascades to related `playlist_songs` rows.
- `users.email` is unique.
- Playlist names are unique per user (`UNIQUE(user_id, name)`).
- A song can appear at most once in a given playlist (composite primary key on `playlist_id`, `song_id`).
- `songs.duration_in_seconds` must be greater than `0`.

## Why SQLite?

A relational database fits this domain because the components are related to each other: users have playlists, and playlists contain songs.

SQLite was chosen to make local testing easy without running a separate database server or configuring credentials. This app is not intended for production.

## AI Usage

An OpenCode agent was used to:

1. Suggest the project file skeleton
2. Generate DB initialization scripts
3. Input validation and error handler utilities
4. generating the readme file
